SETUP
Shuffle all 200 cards into one draw deck
Each player draws 10 cards
Randomly determine first player (give them the marker)
Players agree on win threshold:
Quick game: 250-300 gold
Standard game: 350-400 gold
Long game: 450-500 gold
Place deck in center with space for discard pile

OBJECTIVE
Be the first player to accumulate the agreed gold value in a single caravan type in your vault. When you declare victory, reveal your vault. Only cards of your declared type count toward victory.
Multiple winners allowed if players reach threshold in the same round.

TURN STRUCTURE
PHASE 1: VAULT PHASE (Simultaneous)
All players may add or remove up to 2 cards from their vault.
Vault Rules:
Your vault is face-down in front of you, separate from your hand
Only you may look at your vault
Vaulted cards are safe from theft and forced discards
The first time you vault, you privately commit to one caravan type
You may only vault cards matching your chosen type
You never publicly announce your caravan type
You may remove cards from vault during this phase
Vault Phase Procedure:
All players simultaneously select cards to add/remove
Players place cards face-down into/out of vault
Players acknowledge completion
Any player may declare victory - Reveal vault, announce caravan type, verify total meets threshold
PHASE 2: TURN ORDER
Starting with First Player, proceeding clockwise:
On Your Turn:
Draw 2 cards
Play 1 action card (optional)
Trade with other players (unlimited, optional)
Discard to 12 card hand limit if necessary
Next player takes their turn.
PHASE 3: END OF ROUND
After all players complete turns:
Pass First Player marker clockwise
Begin new round with Phase 1

CORE RULES
TRADING
Unlimited trades on your turn
Trade any number of cards with any player
Trades can be uneven
No binding agreements - players may lie
Any player can accept a proposed trade
ACTION CARDS

HAND LIMIT
Maximum 12 cards at end of turn. Discard excess.
DECK DEPLETION
When draw deck empties, shuffle discard pile to create new draw deck.
THEFT
When Thief is played:
Target player shuffles their hand face-down
Thief player randomly selects 1 card
If target has no cards, Thief has no effect
FORCED DISCARDS
You choose which cards to discard unless specified otherwise.
FENCE TIMING
Fence can only be played during your regular turn (Phase 2), not during Vault Phase. If playing Fence completes your caravan, you may declare victory immediately during your turn.

WINNING
During Vault Phase, after adding cards to your vault, you may declare victory if you believe you've reached the threshold. Reveal your vault and announce your caravan type. All players verify:
All vaulted cards match your declared type
Total gold value meets or exceeds win threshold
If valid, you win. If invalid (mixed caravan types or insufficient gold), you are eliminated from the game.
Alternative: You may also declare victory during your regular turn if you use Fence to vault the final card needed for victory.

STRATEGY GUIDE
CARAVAN TYPE CHARACTERISTICS
TEXTILES - Requires 4-6 cards to win. Consistent, steady building. Good for new players.
METALS - Balanced distribution. Adaptable strategy. Mix commons and rares.
SPICES - High variance. Few middle-value cards. Gambling on rare draws.
JEWELRY - Highly contested. Everyone wants these. Expect constant theft and trading wars.
MONSTER PARTS - Only need 2-3 cards but extremely rare. Snipe big cards and protect them.
GENERAL TACTICS
Balance hand flexibility with vault security
Use Audit to confirm suspicions before wasting Thief
Watch what players trade away to deduce their caravan
Don't vault too early or you lose trading leverage
Vault too late and risk losing cards to theft
Market Day is powerful when you control high-value cards
